# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for an ERC20 token and a vault contract designed to manage the token's functionality securely.

## ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract is a standard implementation of the Ethereum token standard, which provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, approve spending, and check balances.

### Features

- **Standard Compliance**: The contract adheres to the ERC20 token standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications (DApps).
- **Transfer Functionality**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses securely and efficiently.
- **Approval System**: Users can approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf, enabling features such as decentralized exchanges and token allowances.
- **Balance Inquiry**: The contract allows users to check their token balance.

### Usage

To use the ERC20 token contract, deploy it to the Ethereum network using a compatible Ethereum client or development tool such as Remix. Once deployed, interact with the contract using an Ethereum wallet or DApp that supports ERC20 tokens.

## Vault Contract

The vault contract serves as a secure storage solution for the ERC20 tokens, implementing additional functionality to manage access and permissions.

### Features

- **Secure Storage**: Tokens held within the vault contract are safeguarded by its logic, protecting them from unauthorized access.
- **Access Control**: The contract implements an access control mechanism to restrict token withdrawals to authorized addresses only.
- **Permission Management**: Administrators can grant or revoke permissions for addresses to interact with the vault contract, enhancing security and control.
- **Emergency Stop**: In case of emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, the contract includes a feature to halt token withdrawals temporarily.

### Usage

To utilize the vault contract, deploy it to the Ethereum network alongside the ERC20 token contract. Configure the necessary permissions and access controls according to your requirements. Interact with the vault contract using authorized addresses to deposit or withdraw tokens securely.

## Deployment

To deploy these contracts to the Ethereum network, follow these steps:

1. Compile the contracts using a Solidity compiler such as solc or Remix.
2. Deploy the ERC20 token contract first, obtaining its address.
3. Deploy the vault contract, providing the ERC20 token contract address during deployment.
4. Configure permissions and access controls as needed.
5. Interact with the contracts using authorized addresses.
